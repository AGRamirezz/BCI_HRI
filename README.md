##BCI for HRI

This project sets up a demo to prototype using neurotech for robotic system control. It sought a novel approach to address the following points:

-Encoding and Decoding of Language Dictionaries from Brain Signals for Higher Dimensionality Control Vocabulary 
--Precursor for LLM based language mapping 
-Multimodal Language Encoding (Many-to-One) for robust language detection 
-Embodied language behavior elicitation for human operators to more seamlessly produce control signals
-Novel signal processing for encoding brain signals into language based latent space representations in deep learning
